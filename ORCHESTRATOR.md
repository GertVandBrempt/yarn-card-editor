- **Mode**: interactive (orchestrator surfaces topics; user drives sessions in Claude Code)
- **Source**: DESIGN.md open issues and unresolved questions
- **Status**: active — 5 discussion items tracked; no new items since last scan (< 48h, no re-notification)
- **Pending discussion items** *(top 5 by card-design impact)*:
  1. Script Card colour — purple placeholder in script-v01; must confirm before card-index.md entry
