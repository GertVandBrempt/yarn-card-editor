## Project overview

**Yarn** is a card game. This repo is its **card editor** — an Angular web app for creating and exporting card sets. It is NOT a game runner.

Card types: **Location, Character, Item, Event, Quest, Persona, Script**

## Current stream status

### Card Design
**Status:** Active — trigger-symbols-v04-a/b/c created  
**Situation:** Three new trigger symbol variants designed at 48×48 (naturalistic pictographic / theatrical dramatic / heraldic emblem styles). All 6 trigger types covered. v03 marked superseded. Cooldown-trigger-marker-v02 and die-symbols-v02 still awaiting acceptance. Tasks 2–3 (baseline propagation, activation track rework) blocked on cooldown trigger acceptance.  
**Awaiting acceptance:** cooldown-trigger-marker-v02 (a/b/c), die-symbols-v02 (a/b/c), trigger-symbols-v04 (a/b/c)  
**To unblock:** accept one of the cooldown-trigger-marker-v02 options at the review gallery.

### App Design
**Status:** Active — Task 1 complete, Task 3 next  
**Situation:** Dynamic container rendering implemented — removed fixed heights from all 4 effect container sections; empty containers hidden; mech-frame hidden when fully empty. App rebuilt and redeployed. Review gallery synced.  
**Next:** Task 3 (subtitle design implementation); then Tasks 4–5 queued.

## How to continue work

- **Review card variants:** visit https://gertvandbrempt.github.io/yarn-card-editor/review/ and accept or give feedback on pending designs
- **Accept variants:** say "accept cooldown-trigger-marker-v02-a" (or b/c) to unblock baseline propagation and track rework
- **Game design:** handled in interactive sessions only — no orchestrator stream
- **Weekly review:** the orchestrator will pause and notify you when a review gate is reached
