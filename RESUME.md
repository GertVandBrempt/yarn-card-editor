## Project overview

**Yarn** is a card game. This repo is its **card editor** — an Angular web app for creating and exporting card sets. It is NOT a game runner.

Card types: **Location, Character, Item, Event, Quest, Persona, Script**

## Current stream status

### Card Design
**Status:** Blocked — trigger-symbols-v05-a/b/c awaiting user acceptance
**Completed this run:** No work — still blocked on user acceptance
**Next:** effects-v04 (unblocked once trigger-symbols-v05 accepted)
**Awaiting acceptance:** trigger-symbols-v05 (only remaining blocker before effects-v04)

### App Design
**Status:** Active — all queued tasks complete; Task 22 (living task) re-verified
**Completed this run:** Maintenance only — Task 22 (living task) re-verified; review gallery current; variant files in sync (97); app rebuilt
**Next:** Task 22 is a living task — revisited when Card Design accepts new visual features
**Backlog:** None — all queued tasks complete

## How to continue work

- **Review card variants:** visit https://gertvandbrempt.github.io/yarn-card-editor/review/ — activation track v02/v03 variants and trigger-symbols-v05 are under review
- **Accept variants:** say "accept activation-track-basic-v02-a" (or b/c) to advance track design
- **Game design:** handled in interactive sessions only — no orchestrator stream
- **Weekly review:** the orchestrator will pause and notify you when a review gate is reached
